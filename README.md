# Light_following_robot
## The light-following robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to track and follow a light source using ROS, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of hardware components, motor control, and sensor interfacing to create an intelligent and interactive robot capable of following a light source. The report outlines the design, construction, and testing phases of the light-following robot
## 1. Introduction:
The primary objective of this project is to build a robot that can autonomously follow a light source by detecting light intensity using the LDR sensor module and controlling its movement using the L298 motor driver.
## 2. Materials and Components:
The project utilizes the following materials and components:

Raspberry pi/Arduino UNO
USB-A to micro-USB cable for powering the Raspberry Pi.
Car chassis to mount the motors, wheels, and electronics.
L298 motor driver module for motor control.
LDR sensor module to detect the light source.
12V Battery as the power source.
On-Off Switch to control the robot's power supply.
DC Female Connector Jack for battery connection.
Connecting wires for circuit connections.
Soldering iron and solder wire for secure connections.
Hot Melt Glue Gun for mechanical assembly.
